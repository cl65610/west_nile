# West Nile Virus

### By Terry O'Neill and Cody Laminack
The West Nile Virus represents a clear and present threat to public health. Borne primarily by mosquitoes, the disease can move quickly through a community. While most who are infected with this virus only develop minor symptoms (headaches, fever, etc.), an unlucky few may develop much more serious and life-threatening symptoms menengitis and encephalitis (a swelling of the brain and spinal cord respectively). 

Prevention is the best measure in the fight against West Nile Virus. That means eradicating when possible as many infection vectors as possible. Working with a city the size of Chicago, local public health officials have neither the time nor the resources to spray discriminately across the city. Data science can play a critical role in this fight, by preemptively targeting areas where mosquito populations are likely to bloom, city health officials can maximize their chances of fighting this life-threatening virus.
